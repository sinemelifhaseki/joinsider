* Used sqlite3 as database, storage.db was used as the schema of the project consisting of all tables. 
* Due to conflicts while connecting front-end to back-end, I tried to see the results of my handlers and model methods in Postman requests as JSON responses.
* Used sql queries explicitly to obtain data for test since I could not use front-end for CRUD operations.
* Tried to implement TeamDetails.vue as well, but for now it only shows the win, loss, draw, etc. stats for a team.
